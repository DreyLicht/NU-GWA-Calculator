Hello people! This is meant for the computation of National University Student's General Weighted Average or GWA. 

I am Adrian Calongcalong and I am currently a 2nd year computer engineering student at NU-Laguna by the time I created this.

Hope this little project out my boredom can be helpful to many National University students (if it will ever reach a lot of people).

Here's the link so you won't have to find it: https://dreylicht.github.io/NU-GWA-Calculator/
